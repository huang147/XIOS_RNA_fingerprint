# curated graphs
A set of curated RNA structures have been collected from the literature and a variety of biological databases and is extended in this work. This set of known structures has been carefully selected to contain pseudoknots, to cover a broad range of lengths, and to have been the subject of extensive expert curation by the biological community. This curated set includes 206 structures of transfer RNA, Ribonuclease P RNA, transfer-messenger RNA, group I and group II self-splicing introns, and 5S, 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA. The structures in this curated set have been reviewed to ensure they reflect expert opinion on the correct structure, and to ensure that the reported structures are as accurate as possible given existing experimental data such as X-ray crystallography and covariance analysis. The curated structures have been screened to ensure that all structures are full-length, and no pair of structures has greater than 50% sequence identity. Multiple families of the curated structures contain pseudoknots. 


# expanded_graphs
We selected a set of 177 RNA graphs containing up to 25 vertices from the curated data set, and create an expanded set by embedding subgraphs, randomly selected according to probability of occurrence, from the decoy database into these RNA graphs until each RNA graph contained 30 vertices. 
As a control, we also created a decoy set of 45 graphs with 30 vertices, by random embedding of subgraphs from the decoy database only, i.e., graphs with no information from real biological structures except the frequency of occurrence of subgraphs in the known structures. 
Both the expanded and the decoy graph sets are completely free of size effects since they all have exactly the same number of stems. 


# incomplete_graphs
To test the effects of graph incompleteness on the extended-fingerprint Jaccard Similarity function, incomplete RNA graphs were generated by randomly removing a percentage (10%, 30%, 50%, and 70%, respectively) of the vertices (stems) in the curated structures.
